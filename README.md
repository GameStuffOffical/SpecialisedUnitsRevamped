# Specialised Units Revamped
A mod that adds a new type of reconstructor wich allows you to change base units into upgraded versions without changing the "meta" (as in how fortress is long range and how mono mines). For example the Mono gets upgraded into Double (Duo was taken). It mines titanium and mines faster.
